# quiz-game
 
This application is created to have a random question pop up when you click start timer. When an answer is selected then a score will be recorded as well as the next question will populate. Once the timer runs out then a final screen will come up to place in your initials.
I used DOM elements to push text into new buttons through append.Child and also took out the previous placeholder children with remove.Child.
I also played with the hide element in CSS in order to get the starting text and button to remove while the questions were posted.
There was some trouble trying to find a way to subtract time from the timer once a false answer was recorded, but all the answers were stored in a data set to check if they were true or false.
